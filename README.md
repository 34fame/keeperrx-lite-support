# KeeperRx Lite
## Support Site

If you are on this page you probably clicked on a "Get Help" link inside KeeperRx Lite.  

Whether you have questions, comments, requests or problems, please visit the "Issues" tab above and create a new issue.

Over time the Wiki tab will be a resource to learn how to use KeeperRx Lite to its fullest.  That will come a bit laters as the tool gets closer to a release candidate (software talk for production).

## Overview

Have you ever gone to the doctor and was asked to fill out multiple pages of medical history? What medications are you taking? What operations have you had? Is there any family history? etc.

**KeeperRx** helps you keep track of your medical life. Instead of filling out paperwork, simply share with your doctor directly from **KeeperRx**.

**KeeperRx Lite** is a sandbox development project to help with the planning and development of **KeeperRx**. It will let users add medications and then research interactions and adverse events related to those medicines using the _National Library of Medicine_ and the _FDA_ as data sources.
